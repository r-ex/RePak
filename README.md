# RePak
rpak building tool
---

disclaimer: the code is bad and the tool doesn't really work that well

i am fully aware that the entire structure of this project is not good and could be improved massively, but it works well enough for now

if you can make any improvements, please PR them and i'll probably ignore it until someone tells me to look at it (just kidding, ~~unless?~~)

i don't plan on documenting much of anything to do with the input json files for this ***YET***, because i don't feel like it

enjoy?
